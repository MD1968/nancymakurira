 <center><h3 style="text-align: center;">UK targeted sanctions</h3></center> <br><br><p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;">The leader of one of ZANU Pf's lobbyists groups 'Zimbabweans Unite Against US War Sanctions', Rutendo Matinyarare on Tuesday sounded quite discomforted
  by the new UK policy on Zimbabwe. <br><br>He wouldn't even distinguish between a court indictment and foreign policy. In his opinion, Zimbabwe as a country has
  been declared guilty without due process, therefore the sanctions are illegal. The permanent secretary of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services,
  Nick Mangwana’s reaction on twitter on Wednesday was of scoff.  <br><br>He did not see the need to put restrictions on the security apparatchiks because he says they
  did not have business with the UK and never intended to travel there. But frankly he knows the meaning of a sanction; it is a preventative measure.
  This will soon be echoed across Zimbabwean state media and politicians. <br><br>The general tone as usual is of feeling 'wing clipped' and inconvenienced. <br><br>    <center><img src="2nd.jpeg" alt="sanctions"> </center> 
  The ZANU Pf's preferred foreign policies are of blind alliances and open borders for their looted gains. Mnangagwa's lobbying against sanctions that are being
  levied on his business and corrupt connections do not represent the wishes of the ordinary citizens of Zimbabwe. All progressive nations now know that his
  rhetoric of ‘new republic’ carries no political will to bring life supporting reforms for the people. With only 3years in power, Mnangagwa is already considered
  worse than his predecessor Mugabe.  <br><br> “On Sunday, the British Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Melanie Robinson clearly noted the areas of human rights that the she always push Mnangagwa to reform,
  including justice for the people who were shot dead during the August 2018 and January 2019 protests”. <br><br> The only justifiable way forward for the Zimbabwean government now is to
  accept that work has to be done in areas of human rights, governance, and justice delivery. <br><br>This will lay a solid political foundation to guarantee free and fair
  elections, an assurance of a brighter future for all. <br><br> The current misinterpretations of foreign policies is clearly sending messages everywhere in the world that Zimbabwe is still in bondage. Instead of taking these 
  targeted measures as an attack, Mnangagwa can take them as an opportunity to reform and respect the will of his people. <br><br>And so, what I am advocating for as a young
  person, and am doing it so openly, is the fact that it is time for new ideas to enter the political fray. There is no doubt that we have recycled the same people with the same ideas and it is
  time for us to think differently. </p>
