  <center><h3>The youth of Zimbabwe will define ,secure and defend the future.</h3><br><br></center>
    Dear young Alan Moyo <br><br>
    <p>We all know you didn't commit a crime that deserves this long incarceration. My appeal to you is just to remain strong and soon or later the regime is going to fall.
    The regime can not go unchallenged as it does this to a generation that commands the majority Today I woke up thinking about freedom. I have seen many a hashtag demanding the freedom of activists and politicians. While raising awareness is a major factor behind these hashtags what happens after? It has been many moons with the hashtag #FreeAlanMoyo  circulating, yet the young man continues to languish in prison. The episodic visits which used to tell us that he's in high spirits are becoming sporadic.
    <br><br>
    Do hashtags really matter in a society where public opinion is worthless? In a society in which politicians are entitled to support because of their past experiences be it as liberators or those fighting to liberate us from the old liberators?
    <br><br>
    When we say #freealanmoyo what are we saying? Do we feel caged as he is? Do we miss his freedom as if it were our own? Do we have anything else other than insults for those who have locked him up? Have we accepted that those who throw in prison are too powerful and hence activists like Alan Moyo deserve to languish in prison for daring?
    Who do we want to know of his imprisonment and if they know what do we expect they will do? How realistic is it that the international community will come to free Alan? Those in the struggle or who intend to join what can they read into this long unjustified imprisonment of Allan? How many activists young full of potential have been victimised in the same way? What have become of their lives and what does society say to those who choose the same path of exercising freedom against the will of those who hold power?
    <br><br>
    <center> <img src="2nd.jpeg" alt="youth"> </center>
    <br><br> 
    Does public opinion here on social media really matter? Are confrontational strategies effective? Who is winning this fight? Are those being fought on behalf of aware of the fight or the role they ought to play. Does this struggle have pungwez in which the masses enlightened? Does saying its a people's fight really make it one?
    <br><br>
    To those who wield power my appeal is the youngman has learnt whatever it is you meant to teach him. The people are emasculated and beyond the hashtags we just cry out to our Creator. Denying  the young activism is denying them political oxygen. 
    I mean not to stir trouble but plead for the freedom of this youngman for I too am imprisoned in my conscience with him. Alan Moyo is innocent. All he seeks is  better Zimbabwe. He's a student acquiring knowledge to build his nation. A student, who stood up to engage other parents and fellow students to understand  the crisis the nation is facing and just for that reason he was arrested. Allan has now spend 72 days in prison for exposing corruption.  What crime did Alan commit for us we believe he stood for the truth and the truth alone. A crime of that magnitude doesn't warrant spending all these days. He's rotting in prison while those Please pray for Alan Moyo before you sleep today. 
    The  Young Alan Moyo ,will be remembered in the history of Zimbabwe as a fighter who was persecuted for standing for the mass ,being the voice of the voiceless. He didn't  commit any crime The regime is abusing state institutions to persecute opposition leaders and activist. Be strong brother  Alan all this shall come to an end
    Please pray for Alan Moyo before you sleep today. His second bail hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.
     </p>

                by the new UK policy on Zimbabwe. <br><br>The arrest and immediate release of the Former Minister of Labour and Social Welfare Petronella Kagonye on Wednesday went without any international headlines for Mnangagwa. Unfortunately the prosecutors in Zimbabwe are totally useless and clueless because  the government appoints people based on politics rather than merit in order to persecute opponents. As a result the system is not able to get conviction when real criminals are before the courts.  In his first few months in office, he used that strategy to give a façade to the west that he is committed to bringing sanity to the governance mess in Zimbabwe. 
                The ‘Zimbabwe is Open for Business’ charm almost got him the much-needed international acceptance if it wasn’t for systematic corruption that has haunted the government for decades now. In his first State of the Nation address, Mnangagwa well opened up on the extend of corruption in Zimbabwe. He described it as having ‘retarding impact on national development’. I supposed the honesty was necessitated by the desperate wish to be seen as the reformed version of Mugabe. A regenerated student of the degenerate. At that time, his regime was on international headlines with corruption investigations on the likes of the former Finance Minister Ignatius Chombo and his wife Grace.
                Less than 5 years letter, two turns of events have ensued and Mnangagwa hasn’t noticed yet;</p> 
                <img src="assets/News/IMG_0393.JPG" alt="company logo">  
                
                <p><br><br>He is still stuck with a bland policy and the whole world now knows he’s the wolf that hounded in sheep’s clothes. Where Mnangagwa used to trend with his sham arrests, now the likes of #Demloot expose the rot that he carried over from Mugabe to his military backed regime.
                On Tuesday, after the South Africa’s Daily Maverick’s “A Study of Cartel Dynamics” report, Mnagagwa was again trending as a de facto leader of a lucrative elite corrupt cartel running the country. The report estimated that the country is potentially losing more than £10bn per year due to rampant corrupt economic activities. The report exposes him as involved or enabling corruption through price fixing, collusion and permitting monopolies.  This has been proven through a thorough study into the running of industries such as agriculture, fuel, roads and mining.
                His recent attempted catch-and-release on Henrita Rushwaya ended up exposing the Mnangagwa’s government as complicit in more than $1.5bn worth of gold being smuggled. </p>
